In this assignment, we focused on preparing a housing dataset for machine learning by performing data preprocessing and feature engineering. 🏡📊 First, we loaded the dataset using Pandas and displayed the first five rows to get an overview of its structure, including column names, data types, and missing values. Next, we checked for missing values 🕵️‍♂️ and identified the columns that had missing entries. Instead of simply deleting these rows, we applied smart imputation techniques ✅. For numerical columns like LotFrontage and GarageYrBlt, we used the median value, while for categorical columns like MasVnrType, we filled in the most frequent category (mode). To ensure consistency, any remaining missing values were replaced with zero (0).

Next, we performed data cleaning by removing the first row (as an example of row deletion) and dropping the 'Id' column because it does not contribute to predictive modeling. 🗑️ These steps ensure that our dataset is structured properly before applying machine learning models. The exciting part was feature engineering 🎯—where we created new, meaningful columns to enhance model performance! We introduced Total Square Footage (TotalSF) 📏 by adding up GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF, giving a better estimate of the livable space. Another important feature, Total Bathrooms (TotalBaths) 🚽, was created by summing up all full and half bathrooms in both the main house and basement. Finally, we introduced HasGarage 🚗, a binary column that indicates whether a house has a garage or not—helping models recognize patterns easily.

With these preprocessing steps complete, the dataset is now clean, structured, and optimized for training machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost! 🚀✨ These enhancements ensure that our predictions will be more accurate and insightful. 🔥📈
